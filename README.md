# Blog - Server Side Rendered

This version of the app is using my very-experimental / far-from-finished SSR boilerplate - with react-router-dom, redux, redux-saga and typescript baked in.

This SSR boilerplate is far from finished - and doesn't have file-loader/url-loader for the image/assets working, so I have included the images from remote sources.
